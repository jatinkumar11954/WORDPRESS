3. For slider images to be in your wordpress slide the best and free plugin would be
 Revolution Slider Download it from<a href="http://cloudyfiles.com/endezb2p4rmb"> here</a>
 It gives many animation options as well as layer option anda has
 controls to changes the size according to the device.
 
 4. A pop up button in your word press has become an usual and needy thing
 I would recommend Buttonizer  you can visit my<a href="https://usoneinfotech.com/wp/"> wordpress site </a>I am using the same buttonizer
 But it will work with several other plugin(complusory) some of them are
     a. pop up maker
    b. elementor pro
    I am using Elementor Pro which maker the work easier and has many option to trigger the pop up
    I am using a button as a pop up to pop a contact page
    Steps to be followed to create a button pop 
    1. have to install plugin called Popup Trigger URL for Elementor Pro. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-trigger-url-for-elementor-pro/">click here</a>
    2.create a pop in the dashboard>template>popups
    3. edit it with elementor pro as user requires go to advanced settings> open by selector paste the id(#------) from the buttonizer.
    4. after you publish in elementor pro you have to set the condition 
    <img src="https://github.com/jatinkumar11954/WORDPRESS/blob/master/images/conditions.jpg">set as in which page it has to include and which page it has to exclude.
    5. add trigger as to scroll to the element ( in my case clicking that buttonizer button i have to get pop up)- so copy the id of buttonizer and page in scroll to element.
    6.in advance rules u can add the devices and upto how many times any other stuff,
    and publish you will get your button pop up ready.
