 <h3>How to add a button pop up to your Wordpress???</h3><br>
<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><br>

  A pop up button in your word press has become an usual and needy thing<br>
 I would recommend Buttonizer  you can visit my<a href="https://usoneinfotech.com/wp/"> wordpress site </a>I am using the same buttonizer<br>
 But it will work with several other plugin(complusory) some of them are<br>

  a. Pop up maker<br>
   b. Elementor pro<br>

  I would suggest elementor pro <br>

  I am using Elementor Pro which maker the work easier and has many option to trigger the pop up<br>
  I am using a button as a pop up to pop a contact page<br>
  Steps to be followed to create a button pop <br>

  1. Have to install plugin called Popup Trigger URL for Elementor Pro. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-trigger-url-for-elementor-pro/">click here</a><br>
2. Create a pop in the dashboard>template>popups<br>

3. Edit it with elementor pro as user requires go to advanced settings> open by selector paste the id(#------) from the buttonizer.<br>
4. After you publish in elementor pro you have to set the condition <br>

    <img src="https://github.com/jatinkumar11954/WORDPRESS/blob/master/images/conditions.jpg">set as in which page it has to include and which page it has to exclude.<br>

5. Add trigger as to scroll to the element ( in my case clicking that buttonizer button i have to get pop up)- so copy the id of buttonizer and page in scroll to element.<br>
 6. In advance rules u can add the devices and upto how many times any other stuff,<br>
    and publish you will get your button pop up ready.
